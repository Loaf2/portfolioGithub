I found out about programming at that time, and i really started to develop a passion for it. The act of putting together different things, creating systems and solving problems seemed so amazing to me. Since then ive been trying multiple programming languages like python and scratch, until i stumbled upon web development. I started to really love it, because i could see my work real time visually. I loved putting together different aspects of an website, and it allowed me to use my creativity. Since then, ive made lots of cool projects and picked upon multiple tools.</p>
